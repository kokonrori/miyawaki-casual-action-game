> Leveraged Swift/SpriteKit and won a company-wide hackerthon. Miyawaki was used as a basis for a new game project in the company.


## Rule:

You will take the role of Miyawaki-chan（aka Sakura-chan）, a girl one of the top fighters at school. Angry dogs have invaded Miyawaki's town.

`SMASH all angry dogs` within 90 secs to save her town. Be careful of red fire dogs. You can only defeat them to smash them into the water.
